Hardware design of the digital NMR developed in the scope of the european Gamma-MRI project
Abstract
In the context of the European Gamma-MRI project, our objective is to comprehensively elucidate the NMR system we have developed, providing a detailed description of its constituent elements, including the RF coils, the electronic board and the user interface software. These components collectively serve the purpose of generating a magnetic field during the excitation phase of the polarised ensemble of nuclei and subsequently capturing the emitted RF signals during their relaxation. At the core of this system resides a digital electronic board endowed with essential components such as an FPGA circuit, a microcontroller, embedded memory and equipped with Ethernet and USB connectivity to facilitate online data acquisition and visualization via a connected PC. The electronics board assumes the pivotal role of generating an oscillating magnetic field perpedicular to the longitudinal axes of B0, denoted as B1 (in the order of ÔÅ≠T), for disturbing the achieved polarization, acquiring the NMR analog signal from the reception coil during relaxation of nuclear spins to the initial polarization axes, digitizing these signals through an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), storing the digitized data and subsequently transmitting them to a PC for visualization and post-acquisition processing and analysis. To facilitate user interaction and system control, a user interface has been developed, enabling configuration of system parameters, retrieval and processing of data and the presentation of measurements within a graphical interface.

Since the electrical signal to be measured is characterized by exceedingly low amplitudes, typically on the order of a few nanovolts (nV), the primary challenge encountered with this type of systems is the separation of acquired NMR signals from the background electrical noise. To overcome this challenge, we have devised an innovative concept and exercised meticulous attention to shielding of the system and to the printed circuit board design (PCB), which have been instrumental in enhancing signal fidelity. For validating our system, experiments conducted on aqueous solutions containing CuSO4 salt, in order to decrease the T1 relaxation times of 1H, served to validate the functionality of our system, demonstrating its capacity to perform NMR measurements under very low magnetic fields (some mT).
